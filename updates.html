            Terra Nova Medical Clinic (Squamish) will have a physician starting
            family practice in February 2024. The clinic is working on creating
            a patient intake portal for Squamish residents where patients may
            register to be put on a list. We will have a link to the portal on
            this website once it is completed.

            Garibaldi Pharmacy is still expected to be up and running by early
            December and will serve patients wanting their medications,
            immunizations, and those requiring treatment for minor ailments and
            contraception under BC's expanded scope of practice for pharmacists.

            There are some delays in construction. We are expecting to have the
            pharmacy up and running by early December and the clinic to start up
            the first week of January of the new year.
